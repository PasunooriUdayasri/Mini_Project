# Microcontroller-Based Automatic Engine Locking System for Drunken Drivers

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety by preventing vehicles from being driven under the influence of alcohol. It employs a microcontroller and an alcohol sensor (MQ-3) to detect the driver's alcohol level through breath analysis. If the detected alcohol concentration exceeds a pre-configured safe threshold, the system automatically locks the vehicle's engine, preventing it from starting and potentially reducing accidents caused by drunk driving.

## Features
- Real-time alcohol detection using MQ-3 sensor
- Automatic engine locking to prevent intoxicated driving
- Visual feedback through LCD display
- Audible alerts using buzzer
- Motor control to simulate engine start/stop
- Easy integration with existing vehicle systems
- Low-cost, reliable, and efficient solution

## Hardware Components
- Arduino UNO microcontroller
- MQ-3 Alcohol sensor
- L293D Motor Driver IC
- LCD Display (16x2)
- Buzzer
- Battery operated DC motor (representing vehicle engine)
- Power supply circuit

## Software Components
- Arduino IDE utilized for programming
- Code structured with setup and loop functions
- Real-time sensor data reading and processing
- Motor and buzzer control based on sensor input
- LCD interface for user feedback

## Installation
1. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino Official Site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
3. Load the provided Arduino sketch (code) onto the Arduino UNO board via USB.
4. Power the setup and test functionality by simulating breath alcohol levels.

## Usage
- Upon system startup, the microcontroller initializes sensor readings.
- When a driver attempts to start the vehicle, the breath alcohol level is sampled.
- If alcohol level is below threshold, the motor representing the engine starts.
- If alcohol level exceeds threshold, the engine remains locked, buzzer sounds, and a warning is displayed.

## Advantages
- Prevents drunk driving and reduces accidents
- Easy to install and cost-effective
- Provides continuous monitoring
- Improves overall road safety

## Future Scope
- Integration with GSM for remote alert notifications
- Incorporation of biometric authentication for authorized access
- IoT connectivity for monitoring and control via mobile app
- Adaptation for commercial and public transport vehicles
- Enhancement with Artificial Intelligence and machine learning for improved accuracy
